            <h3>What is Tenant Talk?</h3>
            <p>
                A safe space for tenants to air grievances about their living situations or building!
                As a whistleblowing web application, tenants can submit reports anonymously.
                Our site administrators vet each report to determine its credibility, labeling them as either verified or not verified.

                        <li> <!-- Question 1 -->
                            <h6>Why should tenants create an account?</h6>
                            <p>
                                While all reports are anonymous to the public, creating an account allows
                                tenants to track the status of their submitted reports. The "My Account" page 
                                shows whether a report is "New", "In Progress", or "Resolved". Additionally, 
                                tenants will receive feedback on why their report was verified or not.
                                The site administrator will be able to view the tenant's username.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                        <li> <!-- Question 2 -->
                            <h6>What is the difference between resolved and verified?</h6>
                            <p>
                                All reports are resolved after the site administrator either verifies or fails to verify
                                the report submission. All resolved reports are available to review on "Home". On the
                                other hand, not all reports are verified. If either no documents are attached or the
                                proof is not sufficient, the site administrator will mark the report as "Not Verified",
                                but will still appear on "Home".

                            <h6>How do tenants submit a report?</h6>
                            <p>
                                Tenants can submit reports through "Submit Report".
                                After submission, a site administrator reviews the report for its credibility and marks
                                it as such.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                        <!-- Add more questions and answers as needed -->

                            <h6>Who can view attached files?</h6>
                            <p>
                                Because attached files can contain sensitive information about a user's personal information, 
                                only the user that submitted the file and site administrator have viewing access. 
                            </p>
                        </li>
